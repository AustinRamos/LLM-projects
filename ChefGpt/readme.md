This program contains an ai bot with a more general prompt which will categorize your arbitrary input into one of the following
1- 'suggestion' - if ingredients are listed or a suggestion is requested, than Chef Bourdain will recommend a dish based on those ingredients.
2- 'recipe' - when the user requests  a specific dish, chef bourdain will give a recipe and ingredients.
3) 'critique'- if a user describes a recipe than chef bourdain will give you his (sometimes very critical, as you can see below) opinion on it
4) 'none'


## Demonstration

### Interaction 1: Recipe Critique

**User Input**:
```plaintext
I first take a raw fish, i shred it in a meat shredder mixed with pork. then i soak it in water and fry it up in a deep fryer.
```

Response Type: CRITIQUE

Assistant's Critique:

```plaintext
Oh boy, where do I even start with this one? Mixing raw fish with pork and shredding it in a meat shredder is a culinary crime in itself. Fish and pork have vastly different textures and flavors that just don't play well togetherâ€”it's like trying to make a symphony out of two very off-key instruments.
Soaking this strange concoction in water before deep frying only adds insult to injury. Waterlogged, mushy fish-pork mishmash is not something that will win you any culinary awards, trust me.

Interaction 2: Ingredient Suggestion
User Input:

```plaintext
i have a recipe that is toast, with lard sprinkled on top, and 100 pickles
```

Response Type: SUGGESTION

Assistant's Response:

```plaintext
Well, that's certainly a unique combination! Let's see what we can do with toast, lard, and 100 pickles. How about a play on a classic Cuban sandwich?
We'll start by making a sandwich with layers of thinly sliced ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, and mustard between two slices of toasted bread with a generous amount of lard spread on the outside for a crispy finish. Then, we'll top it off with a mountain of pickles for that tangy kick.
```



Interaction 3: Ingredient Suggestion
User Input:

```plaintext
i have the following ingredients, 1 egg, an orange, soda, and walnuts
```

Response Type: SUGGESTION

Assistant's Response:

```plaintext
Well, with that interesting mix of ingredients, how about making an orange walnut cake? You can use the egg for binding, the orange for flavor and zest, soda for leavening, and walnuts for texture and crunch. It might sound unconventional, but sometimes the most delicious creations come from unexpected combinations. Give it a try and let your taste buds take a wild ride! Just remember, cooking is an adventure, so embrace the unexpected.
